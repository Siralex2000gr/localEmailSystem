# localEmailSystem
This is a project where I made a local email system with basic features like sending, reading, deleting an email

To launch properly, you must run first the class emailServer with the first enviroment variable "4444" for the local port
And the launch the class emailClient with the first  enviroment variable "127.0.0.1" and the second "4444"
